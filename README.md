## Tech Stack

The backend is build with NodeJs and Express, with PostgreSQL as a database with Sequelize ORM. </br>
The frontend is build using React Native with Expo framework.

## To Do
At the moment there is no possibility for the user to add data. That's a feature to be added. </br>
Also a station location map should be added.

## The data

The journey data is owned by City Bike Finland and can be found at HSL open data: https://www.hsl.fi/en/hsl/open-data </br>
The station data can be found at Avoin Data: https://www.avoindata.fi/data/en_GB/dataset/hsl-n-kaupunkipyoraasemat/resource/a23eef3a-cc40-4608-8aa2-c730d17e8902
